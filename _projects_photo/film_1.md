In semester one of this class, I learned the process of capturing on film, developing film and printing photos. Later, I started experimenting with this process.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/pinhole.jpg" title="pinhole photography" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    I made a pinhole camera out of a small cardboard box and captured these two negatives which I then made positives from.
</div>

Next I started capturing with my film camera, a Minolta X-700.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/flowers.jpg" title="photo of flowers" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/orbs.jpg" title="photo of orbs" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/plant_shadow.jpg" title="silhouette of a plant" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/darkroom.jpg" title="photo of darkroom" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/abstract_glass.jpg" title="glass of water" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/film/light_glass.jpg" title="glass of water with light shining through it" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Left: A glass of water in front of a mesh chair with light shining through it. Right: Just a glass of water with light shining through it.
</div>

Eventually I started experimenting with double exposures. I layered two pieces of film in the enlarger which combined them into one image when printing. While capturing, I focused on finding things that would work well for double exposures, such as a more textural background layer and a higher contrast layer to use as a sort of mask.
