I spent the first part of semester 2 not doing film, because the darkroom was under construction. Once the darkroom opened, I began printing again, starting with some photos I had captured on a recent trip to New York.

While walking over the Brooklyn Bridge with my camera, I thought the suspension cables were geometrically interesting. To bring out even more interesting patterns, I decided to make some double exposures. However, instead of using two different pieces of film, I exposed the paper once, then flipped it over and exposed it again with the same piece of film. This creates a mirroring effect.
