At the beginning of semester 2, I decided to try a completely new type of photography. I acquired a Sony DCR-PC100 digital camcorder that used MiniDV tapes. I took some videos and liked the lo-fi quality. My first project was a study of light. I edited my footage down and wrote some eerie ambient music for it.

I wanted to use my footage to make some static art, so I used VLC media player to extract a bunch of frames, which I then arranged into these two collages.
